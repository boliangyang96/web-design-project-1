# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


## Audience & Content

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

**No sketches are required for Milestone 1.**

### Website Topic (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain what your website will be about.

My website will be about my personal information and my resume.


### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain who the intended audience(s) is for your website. Be specific and justify why this audience is appropriate for your site's topic.

Future or potential employers interested in hiring a software engineer or web designer.

When those employers want to learn more about me and want to see something I designed and built, they will go to my website. So, they are the appropriate audiences.


### Final Content (Milestone 1)
> Briefly describe the content you plan to include in the final site, and why it's the right content for your audiences.

I plan to include my personal information, education and working experience, projects and also some interesting facts that are not on my resume.

The employers want to learn more about me, and the contents above provide those information, so the contents above are right for them.


### Home Page Content (Milestone 1)
> Briefly identify what content you will include on the homepage and why this content should be the first thing your target audience sees when they visit your site.

I will include my basic information, a section of "About Me", a photo of me, a navigation bar near the top, and contact information at the footer.

When the audiences visit my homepage, they can make sure that they are on the correct website by reading my basic information. Then a section of "About Me" and the photo will give them a general picture of me in mind. So, this content should be the first thing they see.


## Information Architecture

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

**No sketches are required for Milestone 2.**

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> A clearer description of audience: who are they, what are they interested in with respect to this site, and what are the design goals for that audience.

The audiences are future or potential employers interested in hiring a software engineer or web designer. They are interested in what I have accomplished and something I design and build. The design goal is to provide them with my information, experience and projects on the webpage.

### Organization & Navigation (Milestone 2)
> A description of how you generated and considered alternatives for the site's content organization and navigation. You are required to include images here of your card sorting for determining the organization of content and the navigation.

> Thoroughly document this process. The _process_ is the important part of this assignment, not the final result.]

The contents are my information, my photo, education experience, working experience, honors & awards, projects, skills and contact information. I choose these contents because they are the things that employers are most interested in.

![image of my first card sorting](card_sorting1.jpg)
Above is my first card sorting. Contact information is at footer so I include it for each page. Now my navigation has four pages: homepage, experience page, projects page and others page. In homepage, my information and my photo are the most related and should be the first things that audiences see as mentioned in milestone 1. In experience page, both education and working experience can be counted as experience, so I group them together. For projects page, only a list of projects is the appropriate content. Now, I have honors & awards and skills left. I think they both provide additional information but are less important than experience and projects, so I group them together as others.

![image of my second card sorting](card_sorting2.jpg)
Above is my second card sorting. There are two changes compared to the first one. One is that I include honors & awards in experience, because I think honors & awards are more education-related, and can be considered as part of experience. The other is that I change projects page to projects & skills page and then I include skills in the projects & skills page. I think that skills can be well demonstrated by projects, so projects and skills are highly related and can be grouped together.

I will choose the second card sorting as my final organization of content and navigation, because it is a more reasonable grouping, and contents in each group are more related.

### Final Organization and Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Explain how the final organization of content and navigation is appropriate for your target audiences.

I choose the second card sorting as my final organization of content and navigation, that is, I have three pages: homepage, experience page and projects & skills page. The target audiences are employers, and they are more interested in experience, projects and skills. Then, they can learn about my education experience, working experience and honors & awards in the experience page. And in the projects & skills page, they can learn about my projects and my skillsets.


## Visual Design

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

Remember to focus on the things we can't see just by looking at the site: changes, alternatives considered, processes, and justifications.

Each section is probably around 1 reasonably sized paragraph (2-4 sentences).

### Theme Ideas (Milestone 3)
> Discuss several ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Feel free to include some hand-drawn sketches (not digital drawings, not mock-ups, not wireframes, etc.) here to document your design process.

First theme idea is to show professionalism. Then I went to linkedin website to get some inspiration. I would use a light green background color for my header and dark blue background color for the navigation bar. And I would use a light gray background color for the main body. I would use sans-serif font. This color combination and font are similar to what are used on linkedin webpage. I think this color combination would make the webpage very neat and clean, and thus showing some professionalism. And the font is appropriate for the audiences, because it increases readability for them. Also, because I have several sections, I would put some margins between them, then audiences can easily notice different sections.

The second theme idea is to use black as background color and serif with a larger font-size as font. I would use light green color for section titles and yellow for link elements. This would show both professionalism and a cool feeling. Also, the combination of black and serif would give a sense of classic in my opinion. I would use borders around each section to make the separation of sections much clear in a black background. This is also an appropriate theme idea for the audiences. They can get a sense of professionalism and the borders can let them easier to read.

### Theme Design (Milestone 3)
> Discuss your theme designs: how did you come to them, what are their strengths and weaknesses, how do they fit your overall design goals and audiences?

> Emotion is a big part of design. What emotions where you thinking about or trying to convey in your designs?

For the first theme, I would use a light green background color for my header and dark blue background color for the navigation bar. I would use a light gray background color for the main body. I then use sans-serif and gray color for the body's text because it is clearer to read. For the h3 title inside each article element, I would use dark blue color, which is consistent with the background color of navigation bar and also it will be easier to separate h3 titles from the section titles. I would also put some margins between them, then audiences can easily notice different sections.

For the second theme, I would use black as background color, white as color for text, green color for section titles and yellow for link elements. Here, I think white, green or yellow can be a contrast to black, therefore, more noticeable in a black background. I would use serif with a larger font-size for the body to increase readability. I would use borders around each section to make the separation of sections much clear in a black background.

For both themes, I would change the text-decoration for link elements in nav and footer to none if no hovering and underline otherwise. I also would make the font-size for figcaption smaller because I do not want figcaption to take up much spaces.

Strengths and weaknesses: The colors and fonts of first theme are very similar to what are used on linkedin webpage, and thus more suitable for employers. But it does not have borders for the sections, so I need to specify the proximity using margins. The second theme has borders to indicate the separation of sections, which is a strength compared to first theme. Also the second theme would show a cool feeling and a sense of classic in addition to professionalism. But the weakness is that black-color theme is not very often seen in professional websites.

Because I want to show my information, experience and projects, then those themes would increase the readability for audiences and also let the audiences notice different sections more easily. So, the themes fit my overall design goals and audiences.

The emotion or feeling I want to convey is professionalism. And I think the themes above well demonstrate it.


## Rationale

**This rationale should be polished writing: one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.**

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs a few paragraphs (1-2). Sketches can often help tell the story of your design. Screenshots are also useful for describing issues discovered during the design process and how you addressed them.

**All images must be visible in Markdown Preview for credit!**

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.

### Site Layout (Final Submission)
> Show your design process and final layout for your site. You must include photos of your sketches of the layout. No digital drawings permitted.

> You must label each figure and provide an explanation of the sketch.

![sketch for home page](sketch_home.jpg)
Sketch for Home page. I used liquid width for header and footer, and fixed width for main part because fixed width can improve text readability. Audiences can see a photo of me and paragraphs of "about me" in home page. I used a horizontal flexbox to contain the image and paragraphs, and inside the paragraphs, I used a vertical flexbox to contain three paragraphs. Also, I aligned the title, navigation, main part and contact footer to increase readability.

![sketch for experience page](sketch_experience.jpg)
Sketch for Experience page. For Education and Experience sections, there are logos and texts, so I used a horizontal flexbox to contain the logo image and text for each specific experience. I used horizontal rules to separate the sections. So, audiences can easily see education section, experience section and honors section in experience page.

![sketch for projects page](sketch_projects.jpg)
Sketch for Projects page. For each project in projects section, I had a project title and an unordered list to describe the project. In skills section, I had a single bullet point for each skill field. Then I used a horizontal rule to separate the projects and skills. Audiences can easily see a list of projects and a list of skills in this page.

### Audience (Final Submission)
> A complete and polished description of the intended audience(s) for your website.

The audiences are future or potential employers interested in hiring a software engineer or web designer.

### Design Goals (Final Submission)
> An explanation of the design goals for that audience, based on your earlier rationales.

The design goal is to provide the audiences with a well designed and coded website containing my information, experience, projects and skills, because the audiences are interested in what I have accomplished and something I design and build.

### Navigation (Final Submission)
> An explanation of how the final navigation met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).

The final navigation has three components: Home, Experience and Projects & Skills. The navigation met my design goals to provide the audiences my information, experience, projects and skills. The audiences are employers, and they are more interested in experience, projects and skills. Then, they can learn about those information in Home page, Experience page and Projects & Skills page.

### Organization (Final Submission)
> An explanation of how the final organization met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).

My information and my photo are the most related and will give audiences a general picture of me in mind, so I organize them in Home page. In Experience page, both education and working experience can be counted as experience, also, honors & awards are more education-related and can be considered as part of experience, so I group them together. In Projects & Skills page, I group projects and skills together, because skills can be well demonstrated by projects, then projects and skills are highly related.

The target audiences are employers, and they are more interested in experience, projects and skills. Then, they can learn about my education experience, working experience and honors & awards in the experience page. And in the projects & skills page, they can learn about my projects and my skillsets.

### Visual Design (Final Submission)
> An explanation of how the final design met your goals and why its appropriate for your audience(s).

The color combination and fonts are similar to linkedin webpage and thus they are more suitable to my audiences. I also want to convey a sense of professionalism, and the design well demonstrates that. Since I have multiple sections, I put some margins and horizontal rules between them, then audiences can easily notice different sections.
To improve text readability, I use sans-serif font-family; choose fixed width for main part; make use of flexboxes; align the title, navigation, main part and contact footer.

I want to show my information, experience, projects and skills, then the final design will increase the readability for audiences and also let the audiences notice different sections more easily. So, it fits my design goals and audiences.

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> What did you learn from this assignment? What are some of your strengths and weaknesses?

I learned about how to design and code a simple website from scratch using HTML and CSS, and also how to structure the webpage and style the webpage. My strengths are that I am a quick learner and a good coder. My weakness is that I am not a good designer.
