      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <!-- Source: (original work) Boliang Yang -->
      <p>Hi, my name is Boliang Yang and I am currently a Master of Engineering student in
        Computer Science in Cornell University. I am seeking a <strong>software engineer
        internship or fulltime</strong> position in the internet industry. I have experience
        in <strong>making software and web apps</strong> as well as in <strong>machine
        learning</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I obtained Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science in Rensselaer Polytechnic
        Institute with the <em>summa cum laude</em> honor. During my undergraduate study, I
        worked as a research assistant working on the news data and I also worked as an
        undergraduate mentor for two semesters. Last summer, I joined in <em>Moqi</em>, a
        Cornell alumni's start up, and worked as a software engineer for 10 weeks.
      </p>

        Besides my interests in software engineering and machine learning, I also enjoy
        playing soccer, watching movies and playing computer games!
